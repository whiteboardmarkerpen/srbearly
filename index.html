Bored and detached, he reflects on their modest meals and recalls the more flavorful dishes from the night market, which he cannot afford. When Hua announces dinner, Kai dutifully helps set the table. The trio eats in silence, observing customs that honor Hua. As rain unexpectedly falls, interrupting Kai&rsquo;s plans to work the fields, Hua praises his hard work, trying to encourage Mei, who remains reserved. Hua then theatrically offers Kai the remainder of her rice, turning the moment into one of playful affection. He accepts, appreciating her gesture without question.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">* * *</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hua pressures Mei to finish her bitter Dong Quai tea, stressing its importance for fertility. Mei, feeling overwhelmed by the tension, hesitates, staring at the cup, remembering past moments of Hua&#39;s cruelty, especially after her miscarriage. Hua had mocked the loss publicly, while Mei suffered silently.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Kai, observing Mei&rsquo;s discomfort, recalls how she struggles with the tea&rsquo;s nauseating taste, and how Hua won&rsquo;t let her eat until it&rsquo;s finished. He briefly reflects on their youth and the unnecessary urgency Hua places on conceiving. Despite Mei&#39;s attempt to comply, Hua&rsquo;s disappointment looms, escalating the emotional strain in the room.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">* * *</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In the past, Mei&rsquo;s father raised her with ambitions of greatness, teaching her skills in reading, writing, and business, and sharing stories of his global trading expeditions, which fueled her curiosity about the world. When her parents left for Nanjing at the outbreak of the Second Sino-Japanese War, Mei was left with her uncle, waiting anxiously for their return. After news of the Nanjing Massacre, hope faded, and her uncle took advantage of the situation, seizing her father&rsquo;s assets and arranging her marriage to Kai, a young farmer, for his own business interests. Despite the modest wedding, tensions arose in their marriage, especially as Kai&rsquo;s mother, Hua, fixated on Mei&rsquo;s duty to bear children. Kai defended Mei against his mother&rsquo;s harshness, but his words only intensified Hua&rsquo;s anger.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Back in the dinner, Mei, caught in the conflict, complies with Hua&rsquo;s demands, drinking the bitter herbal teas meant to aid conception. Hua&rsquo;s fury melts when Mei submitted, but the pressure to continue the family line weighed heavily on the couple&rsquo;s relationship, setting a tone of emotional strain.</span></p><h2 class="c1"><span class="c3">Chapter 2: 2: Mei (Convinces Kai to leave)</span></h2><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Kai awakens to an unsettling silence, noticing the absence of his mother Hua&rsquo;s usual morning routine. He finds Mei, in the kitchen, lost in thought as she stirs porridge. The tension from Hua&#39;s outburst the previous night lingers, casting a shadow over the household. As they eat breakfast together, Kai reflects on the rain-soaked fields, realizing they can&#39;t till the land, which frustrates him. He yearns for action to break the monotony of their impoverished life. In a bid to distract himself, Kai proposes to Mei that they go &quot;treasure hunting,&quot; seeking any form of escape from their stagnant situation.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">* * *</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Mei, once disgusted by the idea of going to the river, had never participated in tasks like disposing of trash, which were left to servants in her previous life. However, after her arranged marriage to Kai, her perspective changed. Kai introduced the river not as a place of disposal but as a source of treasure. On their first visit, Mei found a beautiful, intact ceramic jar, prompting an emotional reflection on her father&rsquo;s disappearance during the Second Sino-Japanese War. In that vulnerable moment, Kai offered comfort, assuring her that he would take care of her. This marked the beginning of their treasure-hunting adventures. Three years later, despite Hua&rsquo;s lingering anger from the previous night, Mei agreed to join Kai again, hoping to discover something meaningful.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">* * *</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Kai and Mei walk to the river under a shared umbrella, the tension from the previous night still lingering. As they search through debris for anything of value, Kai tries to lighten the mood with playful antics, while Mei remains distant. Suddenly, Mei experiences a brief stomach pain, which Kai interprets as a possible pregnancy, but she dismisses the idea, expressing her disillusionment with the world. However, Mei finds a small jade stone, sparking excitement and nostalgia for her mother&rsquo;s jade jewelry, which had been kept by her uncle after her parents&#39; deaths. The discovery of the jade and some fish lightens the mood, and they decide to return home, feeling that the jade might be a sign of good luck.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">* * *</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Mei brings up the idea of moving to Kuala Lumpur for a better life, suggesting that Kai could work in the tin mines, which are more lucrative than farming. Kai, initially confused, recalls how Mei once mentioned this idea, but Hua had shut it down. He feels torn between his traditional role as a farmer and village chief, passed down through generations, and Mei&rsquo;s desire for a different future. Mei expresses her longing for a better life for their children, beyond the hard labor and limited rewards of farming. Though Kai promises to work even harder and pursue new opportunities, Mei feels her hope slipping, realizing that Kai&rsquo;s efforts alone might not be enough to change their circumstances. She resigns herself to his plan, letting the conversation drift away.</span></p><h2 class="c1"><span class="c3">Chapter 3: 3: Kai (Mun warns Kai about British)</span></h2><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Kai works the fields with his hoe, finding satisfaction in the rhythmic task of tilling the soil. His mind drifts to thoughts of future harvests and the transformation of the landscape from barren to thriving with rice sprouts, providing him a sense of progress. As he&#39;s lost in thought, his cousin Mun surprises him, teasing him for being distracted. Mun encourages Kai to relax and join the family for his 20th birthday celebration, offering to have the buffalo till the field for him the next day. Although tempted by the offer, Kai hesitates, feeling the weight of responsibility and past memories of his mother&#39;s critical voice. He recalls moments from his childhood when he felt inadequate, burdened by the constant pressure to prove himself.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">* * *</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Kai declines Mun&#39;s offer to use his father&#39;s buffalo for tilling, preferring to work the field himself. Mun, instead of leaving, picks up a hoe to help Kai, calling it his birthday present. The cousins work in silence, reminiscent of a bonding moment after Kai&rsquo;s father died when they climbed a tree together. Mun brings up Mei&rsquo;s jade gemstone find, teasing Kai about working harder because of it and about losing face when Mei outperformed him by catching fish. Kai reveals that he wants Mei to keep the jade for a ring, but Mun suggests selling it for something useful, like a buffalo. Despite the teasing, Kai insists that Mei should keep what she found, feeling it&rsquo;s important to honor his commitment to her.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">* * *</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Mun encourages Kai to work in the tin mine, promising higher and more consistent pay than farming. Mun argues that farming is no longer profitable, with cheaper imports and the threat of the British government eventually taking their land. He paints tin mining as exciting and lucrative, contrasting it with the challenges and solitude of farming. However, Kai is deeply attached to their family&rsquo;s legacy of farming, recalling the stories his mother told about their ancestors who settled and cultivated the land. Despite the financial appeal of mining, Kai feels a sense of duty to continue the farming tradition. He rejects Mun&rsquo;s offer, determined to make farming work and preserve their heritage.</span></p><h2 class="c1"><span class="c3">Chapter 4: 4: Hua (Pines after dead husband and baby)</span></h2><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hua reflects on her late husband Bon and how their son, Kai, has now turned twenty. She often &quot;talks&quot; to Bon, updating him about the village and questioning why he left. While Bon was carefree in life, Hua held onto the traditions and beliefs passed down through generations, which she feels have kept her life steady and meaningful. She sometimes feels angry at Bon for not respecting these customs, even though she knows it&rsquo;s futile to argue with the dead. As she leads a tai chi group, feeling powerful and respected by the community, she acknowledges that her authority is now her own, no longer tied to being the chief&rsquo;s wife. She is proud of her status as a respected sifu (teacher), though she wishes her daughter-in-law shared the same respect for her.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">* * *</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hua&rsquo;s first pregnancy was initially filled with excitement and hope for the future, but it ended in tragedy when her daughter was stillborn. The shock and grief overwhelmed her, as she had never considered such an outcome. Hua&rsquo;s family was initially supportive, but soon her mother brought in a traditional expert to investigate what went wrong. The man blamed Hua&rsquo;s actions during pregnancy, from using a knife to eating certain &quot;forbidden&quot; fruits like watermelon and pineapple, which supposedly disrupted the body&rsquo;s balance and led to her child&rsquo;s death. Each new superstition added to Hua&#39;s guilt and self-doubt, leaving her to question everything she had done. Her mother, who believed Hua had lived too carelessly before, saw this transformation as necessary, feeling that Hua&rsquo;s arrogance had been broken by the tragedy. The experience left Hua feeling burdened with guilt and a deepened belief in the importance of following traditional customs to avoid further loss.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">* * *</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">After Hua&#39;s daughter&#39;s death, village gossip turned her tragedy into a spectacle, with many believing the man&#39;s traditional customs were a return to ancestral practices. Hua blamed herself for not following them, spiraling into guilt, believing her actions had invited evil spirits. One night, she broke down, confessing to her husband Bon that she felt unworthy of being a mother. He comforted her as she wept, until she apologized and fell asleep. During her pregnancy with Kai, Hua strictly followed every custom, feeling prepared and empowered. Kai&#39;s healthy birth affirmed her belief in these traditions, and over the next twenty years, she became a respected figure in the village. Leading a tai chi group, she reflected on her success and was determined that her daughter-in-law, Mei, would eventually follow these customs too.</span></p><h2 class="c1"><span class="c3">Chapter 5: 5: Mei (Discovers Pregnancy)</span></h2><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hua instructs Mei to prepare wild orchids for the family dining table, their vibrant beauty mirroring Hua&rsquo;s commanding presence. Mei, who prefers the simple elegance of frangipanis, reflects on how Hua once forbade her from bringing those flowers indoors due to superstitions. As Mei silently arranges the orchids, she thinks about how freely she communicates with Kai, while in Hua&rsquo;s presence, she feels silenced. The tension continues in the kitchen, where Mei struggles to meet Hua&rsquo;s high standards for cooking. Despite years of effort, Mei finds herself continually criticized, especially for not cooking to perfection, a sharp contrast to her upbringing where she was encouraged to focus on education and creativity rather than domestic duties. The dissonance between her past life and current reality weighs on her as she navigates Hua&rsquo;s demanding household.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">* * *</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As Mei prepares flowers at Hua&#39;s request, a small cat appears, and Mei tries to discreetly shoo it away, knowing Hua disapproves of cats, especially black ones, due to superstition. When Hua notices, she accuses Mei of bringing bad luck by allowing the cat near, even blaming the cat for Mei&#39;s failure to conceive. Hua tells a story about why there is no Year of the Cat in the Chinese zodiac, reinforcing her belief in bad omens. Mei tries to defend herself but ultimately backs down to avoid further conflict. As Mei excuses herself for a break, Hua intrusively asks about Mei&rsquo;s menstrual cycle, making Mei uncomfortable and recalling how menstruation had always been a hushed, awkward subject. Mei longs for the ease and friendship she had in the city, now feeling isolated on the farm and stifled by Hua&rsquo;s constant scrutiny.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">* * *</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Mei asks Hua if she can leave, feeling vulnerable, but Hua keeps her, excitedly suggesting that Mei might be pregnant. Hua bases this on noticing Mei&rsquo;s recent nausea and frequent nighttime trips to the bathroom. Despite Mei&#39;s discomfort, Hua places a hand on her abdomen, convinced that her prescribed herbal teas and traditional methods have led to a potential pregnancy. While Hua is overjoyed, Mei contemplates the possibility of being pregnant herself, viewing it as a potential opportunity to convince Kai to leave farm life and return to the city. However, Hua insists that it&rsquo;s too early to tell Kai or anyone else, warning that speaking about it too soon could invite bad luck. Hua&#39;s dominance in their lives continues to weigh on Mei, who dreams of a different future.</span></p><h2 class="c1"><span class="c3">Chapter 6: 6: Kai (Mun beats Kai at soccer)</span></h2><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In a spirited game of soccer in the muddy fields, Kai and his cousin Mun lead opposing teams in a close match. Kai finds freedom and exhilaration in the game, contrasting with his usual farming duties. As the sun sets and the teams are tied, tension builds between Kai and Mun, reminiscent of childhood rivalries. Kai is determined to win, fueled by unspoken feelings of resentment toward Mun, who left the village for the city. In a critical moment, Kai impulsively decides not to pass the ball, hoping to score himself, but Mun intercepts and scores the winning goal. Mun is celebrated by his teammates, while Kai is left feeling defeated, not only by the loss but by his failure to trust his teammates and the deeper emotions stirred by the rivalry with his cousin.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">* * *</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">After the soccer game, as Kai and Mun washed the mud off by the well, Seng questioned why Kai hadn&rsquo;t passed the ball, teasingly suggesting that Kai wanted the glory for himself on his birthday. Kai, though smiling, was inwardly troubled by the loss and his choices during the game. After the others left, Kai and Mun lingered, and Mun tried to lighten the mood, but Kai shifted the conversation to his mother&rsquo;s constant pressure on Mei to have a child, expressing frustration over the hurt caused by these expectations, especially after Mei&rsquo;s miscarriage. Mun, trying to help, suggested an herbal tea remedy, but Kai, already overwhelmed by Hua&rsquo;s insistence on herbal solutions, lashed out in frustration. Mun apologized, emphasizing his intention to support Kai as family. Kai, realizing he had unfairly vented on his cousin, softened and thanked him, appreciating his cousin&rsquo;s sincere offer of help.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">* * *</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Kai arrives home to a lively family gathering filled with the comforting smells and sounds of his childhood. He watches his younger cousins playing a game and his older relatives in loud but familiar conversation. Passing familiar symbols from his past, like a wau kite on the flagpole he built with Mun, Kai feels a mix of nostalgia and responsibility.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As Kai interacts with family members, including Mun&rsquo;s mother, who teases him about turning twenty, and his cousin, who curiously asks about adulthood, he plays the part of the good host. Despite feeling out of place, Kai knows his mother, Hua, wanted this celebration for him, so he hides his discomfort with forced smiles and pleasantries.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">When Kai finally gets to spend time with Mei, their playful exchange brings him comfort. Amid their teasing, she confides in him with a serious revelation: she&rsquo;s pregnant, leaving Kai stunned in the midst of the chaos of the celebration.</span></p><h2 class="c1"><span class="c3">Chapter 7: 7: Hua (Slapping Mei)</span></h2><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hua prepares for her son Kai&rsquo;s twentieth birthday by smoothing her cheongsam and placing a protective talisman on the backyard&#39;s wooden frame, a prayer for his future. As she lights incense and offers silent petitions to her ancestors, she anxiously awaits Kai&rsquo;s arrival. As guests gather, including her comforting in-laws, Beng and Song, Hua grows more concerned about Kai&#39;s absence. The conversation shifts to family matters, with light-hearted jokes about Kai&#39;s dedication to his work and his close bond with his friend Mun. Discussions about rising prices due to the ongoing war add a layer of tension to the festive mood. Despite her outward composure, Hua&rsquo;s worry about her son lingers, even as she exchanges pleasantries about the evening&rsquo;s preparations.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">* * *</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hua, Song, and Beng discuss the rising costs of living and the influence of British colonial powers, particularly their push for Chinese families to return to working in tin mines. This sparks a conversation about the broader implications for their community, and Hua expresses fierce loyalty to their land, determined that her son Kai will not leave to work elsewhere. Song reveals rumors that Kai&rsquo;s wife, Mei, wants to move to the city, which unsettles Hua. Despite outward confidence that Kai is committed to their village, Hua&#39;s growing concern over Mei&#39;s influence leads her to resolve to confront her daughter-in-law.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">* * *</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hua confronts Mei about rumors of her and Kai leaving the village for the city. Mei confirms they&rsquo;ve considered it, citing better opportunities and concerns for their future child. The conversation grows tense as Hua reacts with disbelief, defending the traditions and sacrifices tied to village life. Mei, however, stands firm, asserting her right to choose what&rsquo;s best for their family. The conflict highlights Hua&rsquo;s struggle between holding onto the past and facing the modern ambitions Mei represents. As their argument escalates, Hua pulls back to avoid making a scene in front of the guests, but she remains deeply upset, feeling disrespected and betrayed. Returning to her seat, Hua vents to Beng and Song, who sympathize with her, attributing Mei&#39;s defiance to her city upbringing and the younger generation&rsquo;s perceived arrogance.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">* * *</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hua observes Kai and Mei sharing a private moment, triggering her fear that they plan to leave her behind for the city. Her worry intensifies when she overhears Mei announcing her pregnancy, which enrages Hua as it goes against tradition to speak of such things so early. Struggling to contain her emotions, Hua confronts Mei in front of the gathered guests. Her anger boils over, leading her to slap Mei across the face. Mei, stunned and hurt, runs out of the house. The festive atmosphere is shattered, and the room falls into a tense silence. Kai, initially frozen in shock, is urged by Mun to follow Mei. He rushes after her, leaving Hua grappling with the aftermath of her outburst, bolstered momentarily by the subtle approval of Beng and Song, yet haunted by the consequences of her actions.</span></p><h2 class="c1"><span class="c3">Chapter 8: 8: Kai (Chasing Mei)</span></h2><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Kai races through his sleeping village and into the forest to catch up with his wife, Mei, who has run off after being slapped by his mother, Hua. He finds Mei by a lake, distressed and hurt by the public humiliation. Hua had slapped her for announcing her pregnancy to Kai, believing it was bad luck to reveal such news too soon. As Kai tries to comfort Mei, he unintentionally sides with his mother&#39;s superstitions, which angers Mei further. She expresses frustration over Hua&#39;s actions and feels unsupported by Kai. Realizing the depth of her emotions, Kai chooses to remain silent, sensing it&#39;s not the right moment to argue.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">* * *</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Mei expresses her frustration over Hua&rsquo;s superstition and control, emphasizing the joy of her pregnancy and her disbelief at being told to keep it a secret. Kai reflects on his own past, recalling how his parents kept him in the dark about his father&rsquo;s illness, leading to a sense of alienation. He admits that Hua was wrong to slap Mei but tries to defend her beliefs, claiming she wants respect and that he&rsquo;ll talk to her. Mei, however, remains unconvinced, demanding an apology from Hua, pointing out that she never apologizes to anyone. Kai reflects on his mother&#39;s rigid pride and the generational divide, unsure if he, too, would struggle with apologizing as a parent. Mei insists they must break the cycle and be different, challenging Kai&rsquo;s views on parenthood.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">* * *</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Mei confronts Kai, demanding he choose between her and his mother, frustrated by his continued deference to Hua despite the slap. She emphasizes her need to be prioritized, especially now that she&rsquo;s pregnant. Kai, torn between his loyalty to his mother and his commitment to Mei, struggles with the idea of cutting Hua off. Mei proposes moving to the city for a fresh start, free from the superstitions and control of village life. While Kai expresses discomfort with the city&rsquo;s busyness and lack of nature, Mei counters with its conveniences, excitement, and the opportunities it offers for a better life. She longs for a new beginning and urges Kai to embrace the change.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">* * *</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Kai wrestles with the idea of moving to the city and working in the tin mines, feeling torn between the comfort of his village life and Mei&rsquo;s vision of a better future. Mei insists that as long as they stay, Hua will continue mistreating her, and she pushes Kai to prioritize her and their unborn child. She compares him to a bird tethered by his mother&#39;s influence, urging him to break free and explore a world beyond the village.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Kai is hesitant, defending his mother&rsquo;s role in shaping his hard work and expressing doubt about moving to the city. Mei points out that the British tin mines offer higher pay and better opportunities than the Chinese tin mines, arguing that their future children would benefit from education and a more modern lifestyle. She criticizes his cousin Mun for flaunting luxuries from the tin mines, which fuels Kai&rsquo;s competitive spirit. Despite his lingering doubts, Kai starts considering the possibility of a better life in the city, though he remains cautious about Mei&rsquo;s bold assertions.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">* * *</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Mei tells Kai the British are phasing out Chinese farming for tin mining, with the village Chief offering irrigation in exchange for workers.

Reluctantly, Kai agrees to meet the Chief, swayed by Mei&#39;s belief in him, contrasting with Hua&#39;s criticism. Acknowledging Mei&#39;s own motives, Kai sides with her, valuing her support. When Mei insists she won&#39;t return home, Kai apologizes for his mother, and Mei sees this as a chance for him to truly understand her.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">* * *</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Kai suggests spending the night in a farmer&#39;s barn to escape the tension at home, and Mei eagerly agrees, seeing it as a fresh start.

Watching Mei&#39;s tenderness with the cat, Kai contrasts her unconditional love with his mother&#39;s conditional care. As he kisses Mei, he realizes the depth of his love and their impending parenthood. Despite his feelings for Mei, thoughts of his mother&rsquo;s slap and their uncertain future in the tin mines weigh on him.</span></p><h2 class="c1"><span class="c3">Chapter 9: 9: Mei (Breakfast with Mun)</span></h2><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Mei wakes to the gentle light of dawn filtering through the bamboo beams, surprised to see Kai up early.

Tension rises as Mei recalls the slap and questions his return, but Kai reassures her by revealing their clothes and a treasured jade piece. They plan to use the jade to fund their escape, with Kai suggesting they speak to Chief Tienpao about a tin mine opportunity.

As they eat together, Mun suggests they consider moving to Ipoh, where there are opportunities in the tin mines. However, Kai&rsquo;s competitive nature surfaces, and tension lingers from their previous interactions.

He expresses distrust of British promises, reminding them of unfulfilled land ownership agreements and warning that working for the British could strip them of their cultural identity. Mei, however, advocates for the higher pay and opportunities associated with the British mines, drawing on her experiences in Penang. Mun tries to convince them that staying with the Chinese mines would preserve their heritage and be less disruptive for Kai, but Mei grows increasingly frustrated with Mun&#39;s condescending tone. Kai, breaking his silence, reminds Mun of his past abandonment, casting a tense silence over the conversation.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">* * *</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Kai acknowledges Mun&rsquo;s point that he might fit in better at the Chinese tin mines but insists on considering the village&rsquo;s needs, noting the British promises to build canals to benefit the fields. Mun dismisses these promises, arguing for leaving farming behind in favor of modernization, while Kai stresses the importance of responsibility and community. The conversation escalates as Kai confronts Mun about his sudden departure years ago, which left the family struggling, and the emotional toll it took, especially on Mun&rsquo;s mother. Mun defends his actions, revealing his feelings of inadequacy compared to Kai and expressing his desire to break free from expectations. Despite Mun&#39;s attempt to rekindle their bond, Kai&rsquo;s bitterness prevails, and he rejects Mun&rsquo;s offer to work together, telling him to leave. Mun departs, hurt and angry, as the room is left thick with unresolved tension. Mei, witnessing the clash, feels a mixture of satisfaction and hope, as Kai seems more inclined toward the British proposal.</span></p><h2 class="c1"><span class="c3">Chapter 10: 10: Hua (Confronting Kai)</span></h2><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hua attempts to maintain control over a tense situation, reassuring the crowd after Kai and Mei disappear into the night. Despite her forced optimism, whispers of concern ripple through the group. Mun steps in, lightening the mood with a quiz, captivating the children and adults alike, momentarily dispelling the tension. Hua, watching Mun&rsquo;s charm and ease, contrasts him with Kai, who tends to withdraw. Retreating to the family altar, Hua seeks comfort, lighting incense and communing with ancestral spirits. Song joins her, offering support and affirming Hua&rsquo;s actions, though Hua is plagued by doubt and regret over losing control of the situation.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">* * *</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Worried about her reputation after the evening&#39;s drama, Hua confides in Song, who reassures her that she is respected, unlike Mei, an outsider. Hua fears Mei might convince Kai to abandon their land, but Song believes Kai understands his responsibilities. Hua recalls Mei once using pandan leaves to repel cockroaches, showing her influence. Despite her concerns, Hua decides to trust Song and rejoin the celebration to prevent rumors. As she returns, she sees Mun leading a joyful talent show, though she remains uneasy about Kai&rsquo;s absence, trusting he and Mei will return soon.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">* * *</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">After the festivities, Hua begins saying goodbye to the departing guests, trying to mask her concern over Kai and Mei&rsquo;s absence. Mr. Tan&rsquo;s cryptic reassurance about &quot;saplings finding their way&quot; unsettles her, and she worries that the guests are judging her for slapping her daughter-in-law. As the night winds down, Hua&rsquo;s close family remains to help clean up, though she refuses their offer, hoping Kai and Mei will return soon to help. Overwhelmed by anxiety, Hua distracts herself with cleaning, singing lullabies as a means of grounding herself. However, as she sits alone, her worry intensifies. She reflects on her fading connection with Kai, the pressure of family legacy, and the fear of losing her grandchild due to Mei&rsquo;s pregnancy. Peering out the window repeatedly, Hua yearns for a sign of their return, but only the empty night greets her, leaving her wrapped in worry and uncertainty.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">* * *</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hua is jolted awake by Kai&rsquo;s return after a night of worry. Relieved but anxious, she embraces him, only for Kai to confront her about slapping Mei and making her feel unsafe. Defensive, Hua insists she acted out of concern for Mei and the unborn grandchild, fearing bad luck from announcing the pregnancy too soon, and shares the pain of losing her first child. Kai dismisses her superstitions, reminding her that Mei can make her own decisions. Overwhelmed, Hua lashes out, criticizing Mei&#39;s foolishness and reminding Kai of the sacrifices she made after Mei&#39;s parents died.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">* * *</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hua confronts Kai about Mei, criticizing her small dowry and lack of common sense. Kai, furious, defends his wife and accuses Hua of prioritizing her own reputation and superstitions over Mei&rsquo;s well-being, especially after publicly slapping her. Hua counters, reminding Kai of her sacrifices and accusing him of being ungrateful. Tensions rise as Kai criticizes Hua&rsquo;s temper, saying his father would be ashamed. He declares that when he becomes a parent, he&rsquo;ll never be like her, further fueling Hua&#39;s anger and heartbreak. Despite Hua&rsquo;s attempts to justify her actions, Kai begins packing, preparing to leave. As the realization of her son&#39;s departure sinks in, Hua breaks down, pleading with him to stay, but Kai, resolute, exits the house. Hua is left alone, overwhelmed by grief, as her world collapses around her.</span></p><h2 class="c1"><span class="c3">Chapter 11: 11: Kai (Approaches Junrong about job)</span></h2><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Mei eagerly expresses her anticipation of speaking with the recruiter about potential tin mining work, while Kai remains apprehensive, burdened by recent conflicts and emotional turmoil. The news of becoming a father has weighed heavily on him, and thoughts of leaving his home for a future in the mines now feel inevitable. As they walk to the market, Kai wrestles with his harsh words toward his mother, reflecting on the consequences of their argument. When they arrive at the bustling marketplace, Kai encounters Uncle Lim, whose warm greeting momentarily lifts his spirits, though mention of his mother causes tension to resurface. Meanwhile, Mei&#39;s interaction with a vendor and a pregnant woman further underscores the complexities in Kai&#39;s mind, as the scent of lychees and casual conversation remind him of his family&#39;s traditions and unresolved conflicts.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">* * *</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Mei and a nearby woman bond over rising prices, but the conversation turns personal when the woman notices Mei&rsquo;s bruise and inquires about her well-being. Mei candidly reveals that Kai&#39;s mother slapped her for sharing news of her pregnancy, and Kai awkwardly confirms their relationship. The woman is shocked by the mother-in-law&#39;s actions, while Mei expresses her frustration. After the woman directs them to a nearby beauty vendor for rice powder, Kai asks Mei to say she tripped instead of admitting the slap, to which Mei reluctantly agrees. As they visit the vendor, Kai reflects on their financial struggles, realizing the price of the rice powder highlights their unpreparedness for the future.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">* * *</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Kai is momentarily distracted by Aunty Peng, the beauty vendor, who notices Mei&#39;s bruise and questions whether Kai is responsible. Mei quickly invents a playful story about injuring herself during a ping pong game, easing the tension. Aunty Peng, though skeptical, doesn&rsquo;t press further. She offers Mei a hand mirror and applies rice powder to cover the bruise with care, evoking maternal tenderness that Kai realizes Mei yearns for, having lost her own mother. As Mei admires her reflection, she expresses readiness to meet the tin mine recruiter, assuring Aunty Peng they&rsquo;ll return to the village. Kai, filled with doubt and hope, follows Mei as they head toward the recruiter&#39;s tent, unsure of what the future holds.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">* * *</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Kai and Mei enter the recruiter&#39;s tent, where they are greeted by Junrong, an old acquaintance of Mei&rsquo;s from their school days. Junrong, now representing several mining operations, explains opportunities in the Kuala Lumpur tin mines. As Junrong and Mei catch up, Kai feels alienated, especially when the conversation shifts to English, a language he doesn&rsquo;t understand. Junrong provides details on mining jobs, stating that Osborne &amp; Chappel offers the highest pay, up to one or two Malayan dollars per day, though barracks accommodations are for men only. Mei inquires about opportunities for women, but Junrong explains that women are generally expected to maintain homes rather than work in the mines. Despite her strong English skills, Mei lacks the formal education required for translating jobs. Junrong suggests that Kai and Mei could pool resources with other families to make their move to Kuala Lumpur more feasible, leaving Kai to ask about the potential costs.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">* * *</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Junrong informs Kai and Mei that traveling to Kuala Lumpur will cost around ten Malayan dollars per train ticket, an amount far beyond their means. Sensing their distress, Junrong suggests considering the closer Chinese tin mines in Ipoh, but Mei insists on pursuing the higher-paying British mines in Kuala Lumpur. Kai offers to pawn a jade trinket to raise money, though Junrong warns that surviving in the city without funds will be difficult. Additionally, Junrong reveals that Kai will need an endorsement from their village chief to work in the British mines, complicating their plans.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As they leave the tent, Mei expresses frustration and suggests forging the chief&rsquo;s seal, but they decide to pawn the jade first. Junrong then proposes an alternative: Mei could work for him while saving money before joining Kai in Kuala Lumpur. Kai opposes the idea, concerned for Mei&rsquo;s safety and her pregnancy, but Junrong assures him that Mei would stay with his family. Mei, intrigued by the possibility of working with Junrong&#39;s family, considers the offer, despite Kai&rsquo;s discomfort. They agree to pawn the jade and secure the village chief&#39;s endorsement before making a final decision.</span></p><h2 class="c1"><span class="c3">Chapter 12: 12: Mei (Exchanging Jade piece at Pawnshop)</span></h2><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Mei and Kai arrive at a pawnshop that radiates a haunting atmosphere, filled with the stories of past patrons. As they prepare to present a jade piece, Mei instructs Kai to claim it was her mother&#39;s, avoiding the truth that they found it in the river. A tense exchange with the pawnbroker follows, during which Mei asserts the jade&#39;s value as a family heirloom. The pawnbroker&#39;s unsettling demeanor and meticulous inspection of the jade heighten the couple&#39;s anxiety. As the broker examines the jade with a magnifying loupe, the atmosphere grows heavy with suspense, leaving Mei and Kai on edge.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">* * *</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The pawnbroker reluctantly acknowledges the jade but dismisses its quality, questioning its origin. When Mei confidently asserts its value, the broker responds with condescending sexism, belittling her and insisting that Kai handle the transaction. To Mei&rsquo;s surprise, Kai stands up for her, firmly demanding a price. The broker mockingly offers five dollars, further demeaning them and questioning their honesty. As the tension rises, Mei feels humiliated, reflecting on how her father would have commanded respect in this situation. Kai, frustrated by the insults, threatens the broker, intensifying the hostility.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">* * *</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The pawnshop tension escalates as the pawnbroker&#39;s henchmen draw machetes, but Kai steps protectively in front of Mei. Despite the pawnbroker&#39;s dismissiveness, Mei and Kai remain firm in their demand for a fairer price. The pawnbroker mockingly increases his offer to six dollars and tries to intimidate them by suggesting the police would side with him over &quot;poor farmers.&quot; Mei boldly counters, demanding eight dollars. Amused by her assertiveness, the pawnbroker agrees and hands them the money with disdain, mocking them further. As Kai collects the coins, the pawnbroker places the jade in an elegant box, hinting at its true worth, leaving Mei frustrated but composed.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">* * *</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">After leaving the pawnshop, Kai walks swiftly, driven by frustration, while Mei struggles to keep up, reminding him that she is pregnant. Kai admits his anger over the pawnbroker&#39;s behavior, particularly the underhanded comments and the low offer for the jade. Mei, though frustrated, tries to remain optimistic, focusing on their next challenge: securing the village chief&#39;s approval and funding for Kai&rsquo;s journey to KL. They discuss the possibility of getting twenty dollars from the harvest earnings, though Kai is unsure if the chief will let him go, given hints of succession.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As they walk, Kai vents about the insult of being called a &quot;commoner&quot; and smelling like the fields, while Mei reflects on their simple clothes compared to the sophistication of city dwellers. Although she reassures Kai not to care about the judgments, Mei secretly aspires to be part of the city&rsquo;s world of fashion and refinement. Kai, on the other hand, grows disillusioned with city life, deepening the tension between their practical reality and their dreams.</span></p><h2 class="c1"><span class="c3">Chapter 13: 13: Kai (Obtaining Chief&rsquo;s Approval)</span></h2><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Kai and Mei return to the village, taking a less obvious route to avoid attention. Kai, burdened by concerns, finds brief solace in the earthy air but remains anxious about encountering his mother. Mei, partially hidden under an old hat, silently resents the village. As they approach Chief Tienpao&rsquo;s home, Kai feels the weight of their journey and missed opportunities. They are welcomed warmly by the Chief and his wife, Hongyan, who invites them to join a late lunch. Inside, Kai is struck by the meticulousness of the home and wonders if their visit was anticipated. Mei is asked to assist with the meal, and despite some reluctance, agrees.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">* * *</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Kai joins Chief Tienpao, who belatedly wishes him a happy 20th birthday and apologizes for missing the celebration. Tienpao expresses faith in Kai&rsquo;s potential as a future village leader, contrasting Kai&#39;s quiet strength with his cousin Mun&#39;s charisma. Kai, uncomfortable with the notion of leadership, mentions Mun as a better candidate. Tienpao dismisses this, praising Kai&rsquo;s work ethic and care for the community. As the Chief envisions a school for the village, he suggests Mei could be like Hongyan, his own wife, contributing to the village&rsquo;s evolution. Despite this, Kai doubts Mei&#39;s interest, as her aspirations lie elsewhere.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">* * *</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Chief Tienpao brings up the tension between Kai&#39;s mother and Mei, suggesting it may be driving Kai&#39;s desire to leave the village. He inquires if reconciliation is possible. Kai, surprised by the Chief&#39;s knowledge of his mother&#39;s public disapproval of Mei&#39;s pregnancy, feels exposed by the village gossip. The Chief encourages Kai to mediate between his mother and wife, emphasizing the importance of family unity, especially with the coming child. While Kai understands the value of reconciliation, he remains skeptical, ultimately prioritizing the well-being of Mei and their future child over his mother&#39;s approval.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">* * *</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The Chief acknowledges Kai&rsquo;s plan to leave for the tin mines, understanding the allure of adventure but recognizing Kai&#39;s departure as a necessity rather than a desire for exploration. Kai asks for the Chief&#39;s endorsement, which is granted, but with the condition that a tenth of his earnings be reinvested into the village to help build a school. The Chief also suggests Kai consider becoming the village chief in a year, after gaining city experience. Kai is grateful but conflicted, particularly about Mei&rsquo;s desire to join him in the city. The Chief advises Kai to leave Mei in the village, where she could be supported through her pregnancy and reconcile with his mother. Kai reflects on the wisdom of this suggestion, seeing the village as a nurturing place for Mei during this critical time.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">* * *</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As Kai and Chief Tienpao conclude their conversation, Hongyan announces the meal. Kai observes Mei, who appears more at ease, and they sit down to a simple yet comforting village meal. During the meal, the Chief confirms his endorsement for Kai to work in the tin mines, with the stipulation that ten percent of his earnings go toward building a school for the village. Mei surprises Kai by accepting the terms and revealing her plans to stay with friends in George Town, working as a translator. This news unsettles Kai, especially due to her connection with Junrong, but Mei expresses hope that distance from Hua, Kai&rsquo;s mother, will help ease tensions. Mei also shares her desire to eventually return to the village and raise their child there, envisioning Kai as the future chief. The Chief, agreeing with Hongyan&rsquo;s belief that time will heal the family rift, formalizes his endorsement by stamping a letter with his seal, granting Kai permission to work in the mines. Though still uneasy about Mei&rsquo;s stay with Junrong, Kai begins to reconsider his rigid stance, acknowledging the significance of the moment.</span></p><h2 class="c1"><span class="c3">Chapter 14: 14: Mei (Last Day with Kai)</span></h2><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Mei lies in the barn, feeling a rare sense of cautious optimism after Chief Tienpao granted Kai permission to work in the city&rsquo;s tin mines. She imagines a future where their savings, along with her upcoming role as a translator, allow them to move to Kuala Lumpur together. As dawn breaks, Mei reflects on how their once-daunting obstacles now seem manageable.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Kai awakens, and after confirming their success with the Chief&rsquo;s endorsement, they talk about his anxiety over the mine work and the war rumors. Mei reassures him, expressing hope for their future. Their conversation turns lighthearted when Kai shares a strange dream, and they discuss Hongyan, an acquaintance who revealed surprising details about her origins and Kai&rsquo;s mother&rsquo;s guarded nature toward outsiders. Despite the challenges ahead, the couple shares tender moments, bolstered by their newfound sense of control over their destiny.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">* * *</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Mei jokes about Kai&rsquo;s mother, comparing her to a powerful, judgmental figure in their village. She expresses frustration over feeling scrutinized, especially by Kai&#39;s mother, who, after Kai&rsquo;s father passed, became harsh and cold. Kai reflects on his mother&rsquo;s transformation and his father&rsquo;s death when he was just eight. He admits feeling lost and burdened by memories of his father, who brought safety to their lives, while his mother became distant.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Mei encourages Kai to share more about his father, and they discuss how his father was admired as a strong village chief. Mei reveals that Chief Tienpao found it difficult to follow in his footsteps, and that Kai&rsquo;s mother even aspired to become the chief herself. Kai reacts with surprise but begins to consider how different life might have been if his father had survived, as both he and Mei acknowledge the significance of their respective losses. Their conversation ends on a playful note, with Mei challenging the traditional roles that could have kept Kai&rsquo;s mother from becoming the chief.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">* * *</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Mei and Kai discuss women in leadership, with Mei criticizing Kai&#39;s mother for being closed-minded despite once wanting to be chief. Mei argues that Chief Tienpao&#39;s openness makes him a better leader. Kai agrees strong women can lead but notes men&#39;s resistance to change. Mei realizes Kai&rsquo;s mother clings to tradition because her own dreams were unfulfilled. Kai reassures Mei, acknowledging the importance of women, and they share a playful moment about Mei becoming chief or teaching in the village. Despite the banter, Mei quietly longs to leave the village for the city.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">* * *</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Kai questions Mei about her dreams of living in the city, and she downplays her excitement, suggesting they can return to the village if things don&rsquo;t work out. She demands an apology from Kai&rsquo;s mother, hoping their baby might soften her heart. Although Kai agrees, the idea of depending on Hua for childcare unsettles Mei.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Kai and Mei focus on their future, excited about the financial opportunities from the tin mines. However, Kai insists they visit Junrong and his wife, Lichun, to ensure Mei&rsquo;s safety before staying with them.

The crowd around them is more intense than before, creating a palpable sense of anticipation. Mei, sharp and analytical, surveys the situation, calculating their odds. As they enter the tent, a sense of relief washes over Kai. They greet Junrong, who is surprised at their quick return with the endorsement. Mei hands over the letter, and Junrong expresses his approval, commenting on the importance of their work for the tin mines and the village. However, Kai feels conflicted about the sacrifices being made. When asked about selling a jade piece, they reveal they received only eight dollars, though Junrong suggests it was worth more. His comments on pawnbrokers feel rehearsed, leaving Kai with a sense of inadequacy, as the weight of his responsibilities grows heavier.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">* * *</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Mei asks Junrong about her pay and learns she will earn a quarter of a dollar per day, with room and board provided for free. Kai expresses a desire to see Mei&#39;s accommodations before leaving, but Junrong explains the long commute to his home on the island and gives Kai the address on Cannon Street. Mei nostalgically recalls her past life on the street, while Kai feels a sense of distance from her familiarity with the city. Junrong advises Kai to leave promptly to catch the train and assures him that the train fare will be covered by his referral. Mei and Kai share a brief, emotional moment before parting ways, with Mei instructed to return to help Junrong with paperwork. Kai, though prepared, feels the weight of the letter in his hand, symbolizing the uncertain path ahead.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">* * *</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Kai arrives at the railway station, a grand and awe-inspiring structure, feeling humbled by its magnificence.

Mei stands beside him, equally awed, reminding him of the wonders awaiting him in the city. They share a poignant moment, with Kai expressing his hope that Junrong will look after Mei while he is away. The emotional weight of their impending separation is palpable, as the shrill whistle of the train signals their goodbye. Kai kisses Mei&rsquo;s forehead and boards the train, his heart heavy with both love and dread for the uncertain future. As the train pulls away, Kai watches Mei fade into the distance, holding onto the memory of her as he embarks on his journey.</span></p><h2 class="c1"><span class="c3">Chapter 16: 16: Kai (Train Journey)</span></h2><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Kai navigates the crowded train carriage, avoiding limbs while observing unfamiliar Malay and Indian faces. Unsure due to his limited grasp of their languages, he eventually spots an elderly Chinese man sitting alone. After a silent acknowledgment, Kai sits beside him. As the train moves through the Malayan countryside, its rhythmic motion and a soft breeze lull Kai into a peaceful, nostalgic dream of paddy fields and a lost past, slowly drawing him into sleep.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">* * *</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Kai awakens abruptly from his sleep to a gruff voice complaining that he had leaned on an elderly man named Mingho. After apologizing, they strike up a conversation. Mingho quickly deduces that this is Kai&#39;s first train ride based on his behavior. Mingho shares that he works in the tin mines and had been visiting family in Penang. As they talk, Kai reflects on his own family, particularly his mother, Hua, feeling the sting of separation and loss.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The conversation turns serious when Mingho mentions that the tin mines are paying better because of the war. Kai, though aware of the ongoing conflict, feels distant from fully grasping its enormity. As a vendor with an infant strapped to her back passes by selling tropical fruit, Kai contemplates helping her, but his limited funds prevent him from doing so. Mingho, noticing Kai&rsquo;s struggle, kindly offers to buy fruit for both of them, surprising Kai with his generosity.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">* * *</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Kai and Mingho enjoy their fruit, briefly escaping the struggles of life. Mingho explains that the British tin mines offer fair wages, especially with the rising demand due to the ongoing war. Kai, unfamiliar with the war&rsquo;s details, asks why people continue to fight. Mingho explains the global scale of the conflict, likening it to a football game where Germany, punished after the First World War, now seeks revenge under Hitler&#39;s leadership. Germany&rsquo;s invasions have provoked Britain and France, leading to the current war. Mingho notes that tin has become highly valuable because of the war, boosting Malaya&#39;s tin industry.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">* * *</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Mingho explains Malaya&rsquo;s wealth in tin and rubber, both crucial in war, as Kai listens intently. Rubber is vital for tires, gloves, and boots, while tin preserves food and is used in machinery and weaponry. Kai naively suggests that the rising value of these resources could be good, but Mingho warns of foreign greed and the looming threat of war. He compares Malaya&#39;s resources to honey for greedy empires, drawing a parallel to Germany&#39;s invasion of Poland. Mingho cautions that the British grip on Malaya may not be secure, and new rulers could bring harsher conditions. Kai, troubled by the thought of impending conflict, is haunted by fear for his loved ones, especially Mei, left vulnerable in Penang.</span></p><h2 class="c1"><span class="c3">Chapter 17: 17: Kai (First Day at Tin Mine)</span></h2><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Kai is abruptly awakened in the early morning at a workers&#39; dormitory, where he prepares for his first day as a miner. As he dons his worn uniform, he reflects on the new, uncertain path ahead, feeling both anticipation and anxiety. After navigating puddles in the damp yard, he joins other workers for the foreman&#39;s address, learning the rules and harsh conditions of his new job. The foreman forbids derogatory terms like &#39;gwailo,&#39; announces the grueling 12-hour shifts, and offers rare days off. Kai, nostalgic for his life as a farmer, resolves to write to his wife, Mei, despite his discomfort with writing.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">* * *</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">After a meager breakfast, Kai walks through the heavy morning air, noticing the vast lake ahead, which unsettles him due to his inability to swim. His expectations of underground work are shattered as he contemplates the open water and the labor ahead. Arriving at a massive ship, Kai feels dwarfed by its size. The foreman explains the ship&#39;s operations, highlighting a steam engine that powers a bucket line dredging tin from the lake bed. Relieved that he won&#39;t have to dive into the water, Kai is awed by the machines&#39; power, realizing the scale of human effort and ingenuity.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">* * *</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The foreman leads Kai and the group through the ship, explaining each work zone. In Zone Two, workers maintain rotary screens to separate rocks from finer tin particles. A dangerous job, Kai overhears that someone recently died there. In Zone Three, tin is separated from waste with water jets, and Kai is relieved not to be submerged in the lake. They move to Zone Four, where waste is disposed of, and the foreman emphasizes safety, sharing a cautionary tale about a worker losing fingers. Kai is assigned to work in Zone Three, hopeful to advance, and meets Bran, his experienced work partner.</span></p><h2 class="c1"><span class="c3">Chapter 18: 18: Hua (Market Haggling)</span></h2><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Before dawn, Hua pushes her creaky cart through the dark, guided by a flickering kerosene lamp. She briefly thinks of Kai, who&#39;s been gone for a week, but refocuses on her day. At the market, she greets fellow vendors Sengli and Mina, settling into her quiet spot. Hua arranges her produce carefully, creating a colorful display.

A portly woman haggles over bok choy, and Hua successfully agrees on a price. Next, a foreign man approaches, awkward in the heat and unfamiliar with local customs. Hua inflates the price of okra, and after some hesitation, he agrees to pay, leaving Hua satisfied with her victory. She reflects on the foreigner&#39;s naivety, comparing him to her daughter-in-law Mei, who also misunderstood local ways. Her thoughts shift to Kai, her son, and the regret she feels over his marriage to Mei.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Mrs. Lim, a familiar rival, arrives and haggles over okra. Though she initially walks away, Hua confidently predicts her return.

The absence of Kai overshadows everything, leaving her yearning for his return more than any material success.</span></p><h2 class="c1"><span class="c3">Chapter 19: 19: Mei (Return to Penang)</span></h2><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Mei stands at the ferry&#39;s rail as it glides toward Penang Island, taking in the ocean&rsquo;s scent and reflecting on memories tied to the island. The ferry buzzes with life, as seagulls and fishermen add to the scene. Mei&rsquo;s thoughts shift to Junrong, an old friend who now offers her a job. Their conversation turns nostalgic, recalling a childhood fishing trip with her father and their friend Lichun. Mei regrets mentioning her father, especially as Junrong reflects on his last journey to Nanking and the tragedy of the Japanese invasion. Junrong reveals her father&rsquo;s dream of building a bridge between Penang and the mainland&mdash;a vision Mei had never known about, sparking feelings of unfamiliarity and connection with her father&#39;s untold ambitions. They ponder the significance of bridges, not just as physical structures, but as symbols of connection, with Junrong hopeful they might see Penang Bridge built in their lifetime.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">* * *</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As Mei steps onto the dock, her attention is captured not by the activity of laborers, but by a white automobile where Junrong is greeted by a respectful driver. She joins Junrong in the luxurious car, marveling at the craftsmanship and reflecting on how far they&#39;ve come from their simpler upbringing, where even a trishaw was a status symbol. As they drive through Penang, Mei revisits familiar streets now touched by time, and memories flood back when they arrive at Junrong&rsquo;s mansion. The estate, adorned with lanterns and a tranquil pond, evokes nostalgia and awe in Mei. They discuss the clever design of the house, which utilizes fengshui principles, and laugh about the towering ficus tree planted by Junrong&rsquo;s grandmother.

Lichun congratulates Mei on her marriage to Kai and expresses surprise at Mei&rsquo;s absence from her life events, revealing that Mei&rsquo;s uncle had lied about her reasons for leaving. As they catch up, Lichun inquires about Mei&rsquo;s current situation, including her need for funds before joining Kai in Kuala Lumpur.

A sudden encounter with a maid nearly dropping a tray of tea cups leads to Lichun harshly scolding the maid, emphasizing the value of the family heirlooms. Mei, unsettled by Lichun&#39;s coldness, is reminded of her mother&rsquo;s kindness and questions whether such disdain for the less fortunate runs in her own lineage. As she reflects on her past, Mei wonders if Lichun would have treated her similarly had their roles been different, leaving her with a deep sense of unease.</span></p><h2 class="c1"><span class="c3">Chapter 20: 20: Mei (Shower + Junrong&rsquo;s Library)</span></h2><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Mei steps into a sterile bathroom, feeling disconnected from her surroundings.

She examines the modern shower with apprehension but eventually relishes the warm water, a luxury compared to the cold scooped water of her past. As she bathes, she reflects on her pregnancy, body changes, and the opulence around her, while tears of release flow, cleansing her emotionally. Afterward, she dons a pink cheongsam, feeling a sense of elegance, and untangles her hair, grounding herself after the day&#39;s challenges.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">* * *</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Mei descended the grand staircase with newfound confidence and, after learning dinner wasn&#39;t ready, headed to the library.

However, her concern rises when he mentions plans to travel, triggering her fear of abandonment. As the conversation deepens, Junrong hints at something important he needs to tell her, leaving Mei anxious.</span></p><h2 class="c1"><span class="c3">Chapter 21: 21: Mei (Junrong asks her to help him)</span></h2><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Mei and Junrong engage in a tense conversation about the strained relationship between their families&#39; involvement with tin mines and the British. Junrong reveals that Mei&rsquo;s uncle is complicating business by demanding that the British share their dredging technology, threatening to cut off the tin supply if they refuse. Mei feels disconnected from her family&rsquo;s dealings but is intrigued when she learns her husband, Kai, is involved. Junrong explains that the British see sharing technology as a threat to their dominance, while Mei struggles with the ethical implications of siding with them.

Mei is conflicted, fearing Kai and Hua&#39;s reactions and questioning whether her uncle&rsquo;s stance on British technology is justified. Junrong dismisses her doubts and insists that siding against her uncle is the only way to secure her future. He offers financial security and protection, but warns that without her cooperation, she risks losing everything and being forced back into her old life under Hua&#39;s control.

Kai, disillusioned, realizes that promises made by recruiters like Junrong were empty, leaving him trapped in a cycle of debt. His thoughts turn to Mei, wondering if she knows Junrong&#39;s deceitful nature.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Returning to the lunchroom, Kai shares his experience with Bran and the others.

The threat of punishment weighs heavily on him as he returns to the grueling heat of the dredge ship.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Kai reflects on the futility of their labor, his optimism fading. He confides in Bran, questioning why the workers don&rsquo;t revolt. Bran explains the harsh reality: fighting back risks blacklisting, essentially a death sentence in their world. Even the Chinese mines aren&rsquo;t much better, with longer hours and similar exploitation. Bran offers pragmatic advice on how to survive&mdash;avoid buying from the company store and find goods elsewhere to avoid deeper debt. Despite his gruff demeanor, Bran reveals his own tragic past as the mixed-race son of a British father and local mother, abandoned and alone from birth.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As their conversation deepens, Kai, driven by the need to support his village and Mei, dares to suggest that they might fight back and win.

Bran, Meng, and Chan assist in burying the casket, placing flowers and reflecting on Alan&rsquo;s life. Bran expresses frustration, hinting at Alan&#39;s final wish to tell their story of hardship, but Meng insists on leaving such discussions for another time, out of respect for Alan&#39;s spirit. Kai agrees, believing in the importance of honoring the dead properly before addressing broader struggles.

As Junrong coldly justifies the conditions as part of a &quot;fair&quot; system, Mei grows increasingly unsettled, questioning the morality of exploiting the woman&rsquo;s situation and Junrong&rsquo;s detached pragmatism. The scene highlights Mei&#39;s growing internal conflict about exploitation, choice, and empathy.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">* * *</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Junrong attempts to rationalize the exploitation of the rubber workers, framing the operation as part of a grander narrative of progress and industrialization. He proudly explains how the rubber contributes to global advancements, brushing off Mei&rsquo;s concerns about the human cost.

Yet, in the evening, a moment of respite arrives as Mei watches Noor&rsquo;s daughter play with Lata&rsquo;s baby. In this quiet scene, surrounded by children&#39;s laughter, Mei touches her belly and briefly allows herself to feel hope, the chaos momentarily eclipsed by the anticipation of new life.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">* * *</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">In a small, cramped space, Junrong urgently tells Mei he can&#39;t stay and must leave to help his family, despite the danger outside. Mei pleads with him to reconsider, highlighting the risks, but Junrong is adamant. In a moment of anger, he lashes out by pointing out that the baby Mei is holding isn&#39;t hers, which feels racially charged as it belongs to Lata, an Indian woman. Noor fiercely defends Mei, rebuking Junrong for his lack of help and sexist view that caregiving is a woman&#39;s job. Mei firmly refuses to leave with Junrong. Frustrated, he leaves angrily, devastating Mei. Noor comforts her, advising to focus on themselves and the baby.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As Mei contemplates the present, memories of her parents&#39; deaths during the Nanjing massacre surface.

Mei then reaches the crowded maternity ward, overwhelmed by the chaos and empathy for the mothers torn between nurturing infants and the surrounding violence. She finds Lata, the infant&#39;s mother, recovering from a hemorrhage. With the help of a nurse named Ranjeetha, who praises Mei&#39;s selfless acts, Lata and her baby, named Durga, are reunited. Despite her gratitude, Mei worries about Chandra&rsquo;s fate and faces uncertainties about the future amid the Japanese invasion. Mei wonders how Junrong would react and reflects on the strength shown by displaying her emotions.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">* * *</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Outside the maternity ward, Mei asks Ranjeetha about covering Lata&#39;s treatment costs, feeling the weight of her promise, especially without Junrong&#39;s financial support. Ranjeetha reassures Mei that they will find a way to make the treatment manageable. Nurse Lin joins them, recognizing Mei and praising her for her contributions in the supply room and her skill in treating wounds, learned from her mother-in-law. Ranjeetha invites Mei to a staff meeting about handling the hospital&#39;s situation with many staff leaving due to fear of the Japanese invasion. Mei is initially hesitant but agrees, encouraged by Lin. During their conversation, Ranjeetha and Lin discuss the departure of several expatriate doctors, particularly Dr. Smith, who left to protect his family. This conversation triggers painful memories for Mei, whose parents died in Nanjing, and she feels the unfairness of the British doctors fleeing while locals face the same or greater dangers. Despite the heavy atmosphere, Mei feels a sense of purpose and camaraderie as she prepares to join the meeting, contemplating what her life might have been if she pursued a career in medicine.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">* * *</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">At the staff meeting, Mei notices Dr. Abdul, a Malay doctor, leading with authority.

Frustrated by the recent exodus of other doctors, Dr. Abdul challenges anyone else wanting to leave to do so immediately. Nurse Lin and others commit to staying, fostering a sense of solidarity and resolve. This mutual support shifts the mood from fear to determination. Dr. Abdul, visibly relieved, stresses prioritizing efforts and managing scarce supplies. He suggests rationing and turning to traditional medicine, urging anyone with relevant experience to step forward.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">* * *</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">A weighted silence fills the room as Mei, with a mix of apprehension and determination, raises her hand.

Dr. Abdul, impressed and hopeful, asks Mei to assist Nurse Lin in incorporating traditional remedies into their depleted resources. As the staff begins their new rotation, Mei feels a surge of pride and determination. Over the next two days, she dedicates herself to preparing herbal remedies, finding purpose and comfort in her work. Reflecting on her past and family, Mei vows to help others if she ever becomes wealthy. On December 13, 1941, after the air raids cease, she feels her baby&#39;s first kick.

Kai finds Meng, who explains that the disassembly is a &quot;major overhaul,&quot; likely to prevent the Japanese from accessing the tin dredge technology. Kai realizes the British are abandoning them, fueling his anger. Meng tries to convince Kai that staying put might ensure their survival. He recounts the painful memory of Alan&#39;s death, emphasizing the futility of rebellion. Kai, however, refuses to accept defeat and secretly plans to escape to Penang that night. Despite promising Meng not to act recklessly, Kai feels disillusioned with the British and Meng&#39;s submission. He resolves to keep hope alive for the sake of his family and find another path to freedom.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">* * *</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">That evening, a persistent drizzle covers the camp. After midnight, Kai, carrying firewood, discreetly meets Zichen and Ziyoung. They prepare to execute their escape plan.

Kai bolts forward, hindered by the jungle&#39;s obstacles and the pain from his fall. He struggles through the underbrush, realizing he has no clear direction. Panic surges as he stumbles into a stream, only to be caught by the guards. They slam him back into the water, and strong hands wrench him up, binding his wrists painfully.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Dragged back to the camp, Kai recognizes the path and sees a crowd gathered, their faces mixed with curiosity and pity. Meng&#39;s disbelief hits him hard as the guards silence the onlookers and haul Kai to the barracks.

Mei feels trapped, as her family is either estranged or unhelpful, leading her to lean toward returning to Butterworth despite the risks.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ranjeetha, more pragmatic, advises Mei to consider family support, even if imperfect, over raising a baby alone. Mei ultimately decides to leave, hoping her mother-in-law will soften upon seeing her grandchild.

As he surveys the grim surroundings, he realizes he&#39;s in the very camp he tried to avoid. The arrival of a guard interrupts his thoughts, forcing him into compliance under threat. Despite his instinct to resist, memories of his mother&rsquo;s discipline compel him to obey. Cuffed and in agony, Kai is led through the camp, where he anxiously searches for signs of his friends Bran and Wen among the detainees.

When asked why he didn&rsquo;t request a pass, Kai reveals his frustration with debt and the oppressive system. The foreman dismisses his pleas, mocking his inability to pay off his debt and ridiculing his hope of returning.

He argues that Kai would be foolish not to take the same path, stressing the harsh, dog-eat-dog reality of their world. Imagining the foreman&#39;s cruelty, Kai&#39;s resolve strengthens against the temptation of personal gain.

Despite Mei&rsquo;s lingering distrust, Lin insists that the offer may be Mei&rsquo;s safest option, given the looming threats.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">* * *</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As Lin tries to defend Mei&#39;s uncle, describing his care for a dying woman, Mei realizes with horror that the woman Lin is referring to is her own mother. The mention of her mother&#39;s yellow batik scarf triggers painful memories of her mother&rsquo;s long illness and the absence of her father, who was always away on business&mdash;even missing the funeral. Mei explains how her uncle&#39;s behavior changed after her mother&#39;s death, becoming consumed by anger and grief. She suspects that his anger stemmed from resentment toward her father for abandoning her mother during her final days. Mei recalls her own childhood of waiting for her father&rsquo;s return from long trips, a pattern that culminated in his final, fatal journey to Nanjing. The realization leaves Mei overwhelmed with grief and unresolved bitterness over her family&rsquo;s broken promises and abandonment.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">* * *</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Mei reflects bitterly on her uncle&rsquo;s decision to arrange her marriage to Mr. Won, convinced it was his way of punishing her. She believes he resented her for causing her mother&rsquo;s illness and saw her as a constant reminder of his brother&rsquo;s failures&mdash;abandoning his dying wife and leaving Mei to bear the blame. To her uncle, Mei had become a problem to be &ldquo;fixed&rdquo; by marrying her off, a way to rid himself of her and the painful memories she represented. Now, she views his invitation to return home as a calculated move to regain control, rather than a genuine attempt at reconciliation.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lin listens quietly, then offers a different perspective, suggesting that Mei&rsquo;s uncle might have been overwhelmed by his own grief and guilt. She points out that staying by Mei&rsquo;s mother&rsquo;s side during her illness wasn&rsquo;t the act of a man entirely without care, and wonders if he&rsquo;s truly trying to make amends. But Mei, still burdened by years of anger and betrayal, questions whether her uncle&rsquo;s actions can ever be redeemed, unable to see his recent gestures as anything more than hollow performances.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">* * *</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Mei grapples with her distrust of her uncle, fearing his offer might be another trap to control her, especially with her baby&rsquo;s safety at stake. Lin counters, acknowledging the risk but emphasizing the more immediate danger of staying&mdash;bombings and the perilous ferry ride. She reminds Mei that, although the situation isn&rsquo;t ideal, her fear will keep her alert and ready to act if things go wrong. Lin reassures her that she has allies, like herself and Ranjeetha, and that this is a temporary solution until the British regain control.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As Mei reflects on her past&mdash;her strength during her mother&rsquo;s death and her ability to survive her uncle&rsquo;s previous attempts to break her&mdash;she begins to realize how much she&rsquo;s changed. The memory of rescuing Lata and enduring hardships gives her the resolve she needs. Lin&rsquo;s steady encouragement helps Mei see that she isn&rsquo;t powerless. Though Mei remains uncertain, Lin&rsquo;s belief in her resilience plants a seed of confidence, urging her to finish what she started&mdash;for herself, her baby, and her future.</span></p><h2 class="c1"><span class="c3">Chapter 42: 42: Mei (Homecoming)</span></h2><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Mei waits anxiously, torn over her decision to call her uncle for help, fearing the consequences. Her friends, Lin and Ranjeetha, offer support&mdash;Lin providing reassurance and Ranjeetha setting firm expectations for Mei&rsquo;s return. When Chandra arrives, sent by Mei&rsquo;s uncle, the group discusses the possibility of her uncle assisting with Lata&#39;s medical bills, although Mei remains skeptical of his true intentions. Chandra shares his own experience of receiving help from the uncle, momentarily kindling hope in Mei, though she quickly suppresses it, unwilling to trust again.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As Mei leaves with Chandra, the devastation of war outside overwhelms her&mdash;Penang reduced to ruins, with the scent of destruction thick in the air. The destruction intensifies Mei&#39;s anger and despair, as she contemplates the relentless advance of the Japanese and the fragility of British defenses. Her thoughts swirl in the face of impending doom, but despite the destruction, her uncle&rsquo;s house stands untouched, a haunting reminder of the stark contrast between her past and the world unraveling around her. The scene closes with Mei confronting the unchanged facade of the house, realizing how drastically the world&mdash;and she&mdash;has changed.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">* * *</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Mei steps into the courtyard of her uncle&rsquo;s home, where her aunt Yunli greets her with a mix of disbelief and overwhelming relief. Yunli embraces her tightly, expressing how she thought she&rsquo;d never see Mei again. Mei, flooded with guilt and uncertainty, struggles to find the right words, but Yunli reassures her, reminding her that this house is still her home. Yunli acknowledges the bombings outside but insists that no matter what happens, Mei&rsquo;s family will protect her.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Despite her aunt&rsquo;s warmth, Mei feels a cold distance inside. She&rsquo;s not here for love or comfort&mdash;she&rsquo;s returned for the protection her uncle&rsquo;s name could offer her and her unborn child as the war closes in. The thought of Uncle Boon unsettles Mei. She doesn&rsquo;t trust his recent kindness, suspecting it&rsquo;s a manipulation meant to trap her again. She plans to test him and flee if he shows his true controlling nature, just like she did before. Her thoughts drift back to Butterworth, where at least her mother-in-law would care for the baby, even if Mei couldn&rsquo;t trust anyone else.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yunli, noticing Mei&rsquo;s tension at the mention of Boon, offers to take her to rest, mentioning her uncle&rsquo;s promise of letting her see her father&rsquo;s letters. Mei is gripped by fear at the thought of what those letters might reveal&mdash;whether they&rsquo;d confirm her long-held suspicion that her father blamed her for her mother&rsquo;s illness.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">* * *</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Mei, overwhelmed by the past and the weight of returning to her uncle&rsquo;s home, asks to visit the family shrine as a way to steady herself. The ancestral altar, a place of stone and tradition, offers her a brief escape from her swirling emotions. As she lights incense and bows before the names of her ancestors, guilt and grief wash over her&mdash;especially for having stayed away so long. She&rsquo;s haunted by thoughts of her ancestors, wondering if they would still recognize her or claim her child as part of the family lineage. The act of offering incense brings a brief sense of grounding, but the tension within her remains.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yunli reassures her gently, acknowledging that Mei is back where she belongs. Yet, as they move through the house to her old room, Mei feels the dissonance between the familiar surroundings and the sense of distance she carries. Her childhood room is preserved, almost frozen in time, with even the addition of a crib hinting at her aunt&rsquo;s desire for her to stay and be safe.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">* * *</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Mei opens her father&rsquo;s box. The first letters she reads are cold and businesslike, filled with impersonal updates on his work. There&rsquo;s no warmth, no affection&mdash;just the same formality she remembers from her childhood. Though she fears he may have blamed her for her mother&rsquo;s death, the letters offer no such accusations, easing that worry but doing little to fill the emotional void he left behind. One letter from New York stands out. In it, her father describes a visit to a sugar refinery and, for the first time, uses the phrase &ldquo;my dear.&rdquo; This small hint of affection catches Mei off guard. Along with the letter, she finds a packet of sugar from the factory, a souvenir of his journey. She tastes the sugar, but its fleeting sweetness only deepens her frustration, reminding her of the promises her father never fulfilled. The sugar becomes a symbol of his empty words and missed opportunities.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As Mei reflects, she realizes how deeply his absence shaped her life. Her father, who had always seemed full of grand plans and dreams, never followed through on the things that truly mattered. He wasn&rsquo;t there to stop Uncle Boon from arranging her marriage or to protect her when she needed him most. The man she had idealized&mdash;a visionary, a dreamer&mdash;feels like a hollow figure now. His actions revealed him to be disconnected and unreliable, much like Uncle Boon. A knock on the door interrupts her thoughts. Aunt Yunli tells her that Ah Ma wants to see her.</span></p><h2 class="c1"><span class="c3">Chapter 43: 43: Mei (Confronting Ah Ma)</span></h2><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Mei enters the herb garden with Aunt Yunli but is left alone to confront her past. As she immerses herself in the earthy, practical world of the garden, she reflects on the stark contrast between its authenticity and the lifelessness of Junrong&rsquo;s estate. Her thoughts shift to her late grandmother, Ah Ma, and mother-in-law, Hua, recognizing how both women, despite their differences, shared similar burdens and resilience, including their oppression of her. Mei recalls the painful memory of Ah Ma&rsquo;s refusal to stop her forced marriage, igniting lingering resentment.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Mei&#39;s growing anger is tempered by the realization of her present dilemma. Despite her urge to flee the oppressive control of her family, Mei decides to stay, considering the dangers of the Japanese advance and the relative safety of her uncle&rsquo;s home. Her focus sharpens on her unborn child&rsquo;s well-being, resolving to leave the moment her uncle or Ah Ma poses a direct threat to her autonomy or her baby&rsquo;s future.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">* * *</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ah Ma confronts Mei in the garden, frail but still commanding authority. Mei is struck by her grandmother&rsquo;s physical decline but resists showing weakness. Ah Ma, sharp as ever, comments on Mei&rsquo;s pregnancy and probes for details about the father. Mei struggles to speak about Kai, her husband, whose letters have stopped. When she explains that he is working on a British tin dredge, Ah Ma reacts with disdain, describing the horrors of indentured labor and implicating Junrong, the man who offered Kai the job.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As the truth about Kai&rsquo;s dire situation sinks in, Mei feels guilt and anger, realizing the extent of her mistake in trusting Junrong. Ah Ma dismisses Kai as a lost cause, urging Mei to stay with her family for safety, especially with the Japanese threat looming. However, Mei&rsquo;s resolve hardens. She refuses to abandon her husband, despite Ah Ma&rsquo;s warnings about the dangers of returning to Butterworth.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Mei&rsquo;s long-suppressed anger boils over, and she confronts her grandmother about her past inaction. She accuses Ah Ma of failing to protect her when Uncle Boon tried to force her into marriage with Mr. Won, highlighting the deep emotional wounds caused by her family&rsquo;s control. Mei stands defiant, determined to reclaim her agency and make her own choices.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">* * *</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ah Ma confronts Mei&rsquo;s outburst, commanding her to sit with the same authority Mei has always feared. Mei declares her intention to leave, vowing that neither Ah Ma nor Uncle Boon will control her or take her baby. Ah Ma, however, reveals a surprising truth&mdash;Uncle Boon had been working to pay off Mr. Won, freeing Mei from the arranged marriage long before she fled. Confused, Mei struggles to understand why her family, who had forced her into the engagement, would also work to undo it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The tension between them escalates as Mei accuses Ah Ma of manipulation, recalling the years of control and neglect. When Ah Ma gently touches Mei&rsquo;s cheek and whispers, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re mine,&rdquo; it sends a chill through Mei, making her realize just how possessive and controlling her grandmother has always been. Mei pulls away, reaffirming her decision to leave the family for good.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ah Ma&rsquo;s facade finally cracks as she pleads with Mei not to return to Butterworth, warning her of the dangers. But Mei remains resolute, determined to leave before Uncle Boon returns. As Mei&rsquo;s harsh words sink in, Ah Ma, unexpectedly vulnerable, whispers Mei&rsquo;s father&rsquo;s name, revealing a painful family secret. Mei learns that her father had been a gambler, accumulating debts that led to him promising his daughter&rsquo;s hand in marriage as a means of repayment. The revelation shatters Mei&rsquo;s understanding of her father, who had always preached discipline, leaving her reeling from the truth that she had been used as collateral for his failures.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">* * *</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Mei learns a devastating truth: her father had promised her in marriage to Mr. Won to settle his gambling debts. Overwhelmed by the revelation, she grapples with the betrayal, as her grandmother, Ah Ma, explains how her uncle Boon had been working to free her from this fate. Despite their efforts, Mei fled before learning that the debt had been paid off. Mei&rsquo;s emotions spiral as she realizes her father&rsquo;s role in the arrangement, shattering her perception of him. In a rare moment of vulnerability, Ah Ma shows affection and regret, revealing how the family had struggled to protect her. Mei, who had planned to run away again, begins to question her desire to leave, faced with her grandmother&rsquo;s plea not to lose her a second time.</span></p><h2 class="c1"><span class="c3">Chapter 44: 44: Mei (Unpacking Ah Ma&#39;s Revelations</span></h2><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Mei returns to her room, burdened by her grandmother Ah Ma&rsquo;s unsettling revelations. She grapples with the difficult decision of whether to stay in Butterworth or flee as Japanese forces advance, all while dealing with her pregnancy. The room symbolizes her shattered trust, particularly the crib that once represented hope but now stands as a reminder of deceit, especially regarding her father&#39;s betrayal. Mei confronts letters from her absent father, realizing his actions have doomed her future and contributed to Kai&rsquo;s suffering.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Overwhelmed by grief and anger, Mei destroys the letters, feeling utterly alone and responsible for Kai&rsquo;s dire situation.

She quickly dresses in her cheongsam and navigates the lively household, noticing the servants and the aromas of breakfast and jasmine. At Uncle Boon&rsquo;s study, Mei overhears a tense discussion about the rapid advance of Japanese forces and the need to finalize evacuation routes, highlighting the imminent threat to their safety.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">When Mei enters, Uncle Boon dismisses his associates to talk privately. She confronts him about the hidden truth of her engagement to Mr. Won, accusing him of treating her like a commodity and betraying her trust. Uncle Boon reveals that her father made him keep the secret to protect her memories, but Mei feels deeply hurt and believes he prioritized family reputation over her well-being.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Their heated exchange uncovers deeper family tensions and Mei&rsquo;s fears about Kai, her husband stranded on a British-controlled tin dredge. Uncle Boon says he has been trying to help Kai, acknowledging past failures and expressing his desire to save both Kai and Mei from further suffering. This confession begins to bridge the emotional gap between them, revealing Uncle Boon&rsquo;s vulnerability and guilt over past decisions.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">As Mei insists on going to find Kai, Uncle Boon shares that a healer named Hua, Mei&rsquo;s mother-in-law, is at the hospital in Butterworth.

Despite the risk of severe punishment, they managed to distribute medical supplies, food, and other essentials to civilians who were wounded or in hiding. The Malayan People&rsquo;s Anti-Japanese Army (MPAJA), which was predominantly made up of Chinese guerrillas, played a significant role in these efforts, working underground to resist the occupation and provide support to their communities.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">These covert operations were vital in maintaining some degree of welfare for the local population during the harsh and oppressive Japanese rule, which included frequent raids and mass arrests.</span></p><h2 class="c1"><span class="c3">Chapter 48: 46: Hua (Coping with Japanese)</span></h2><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&bull; Scene 1: Coping with Occupation</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hua reflects on the Japanese occupation, initially hopeful about the &ldquo;Asia for Asians&rdquo; rhetoric, but quickly disillusioned by the harsh realities.

Railway (Initial Leg):</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&bull; If the railway was still partially operational or if some tracks had not yet been destroyed, a person might begin their journey by train. The main railway line connected Ipoh (in Kinta Valley) to Penang, passing through several towns. However, given the sabotage by retreating British forces and Japanese military activity, this option would have been highly unreliable and potentially dangerous. The journey could have been abruptly halted by damaged tracks, destroyed bridges, or Japanese checkpoints.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">2. Road Transport (Most Likely):</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&bull; With the railway likely disrupted, the next best option would have been by road. Traveling by car, truck, or even bicycle along the main road connecting Ipoh to Penang would have been plausible. This road route, which was parallel to the railway, might still have been usable, although it would have been risky due to Japanese patrols and possible roadblocks.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&bull; The road distance between Ipoh (Kinta Valley) and Penang is approximately 160 kilometers (100 miles). Under normal circumstances, this trip might take a few hours by car, but during the invasion, it could take much longer due to the conditions mentioned above.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&bull; Forest/Jungle Route: The journey by foot through the jungle could take several days to over a week, depending on the specific route taken, the speed of travel, and the need to avoid detection. The distance between the Kinta Valley (e.g., from Ipoh) to Penang is around 150-200 kilometers (about 90-125 miles). Given the terrain, this could translate to around 10-15 kilometers (6-9 miles) per day, especially if avoiding main roads and traveling in secrecy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&bull; Waterway Route: If part of the journey could be made by river or small boats, this might reduce travel time, but it would still likely take several days, given the need for caution and the potential for detours to avoid Japanese patrols.</span></p><p class="c1 c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Scene 3: Kai has to realize on that butterworth was completely blocked off, and there was no way they could go. there are so many reports. mun comes along.

These projects were crucial for maintaining and expanding the Japanese military&rsquo;s reach in the region. The forced labor was often brutal, with poor living conditions and high mortality rates among the conscripted workers. At the same time, the Japanese were acutely aware of the importance of maintaining food production, especially rice, which was a staple food for both the local population and the occupying forces. Therefore, they imposed strict controls on agricultural production. Farmers were often required to continue working their fields under Japanese supervision to ensure that rice production did not decline. The Japanese enforced quotas and controlled the distribution of agricultural produce, which was often diverted to feed Japanese troops. In some cases, entire villages were designated as agricultural production zones, where the inhabitants were forced to continue farming under oppressive conditions</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Kai chats with uncle beng, who says everything is down.
